        <h2>Term</h2>
        <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games that do not progress incrementally in turns,
          but allow all players to play simultaneously, in "real time". By contrast, in turn-based strategy (TBS) games,
          players take turns to play. The term "real-time strategy" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the
          early 1990s.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>In a real-time strategy game, each participant positions structures and maneuvers multiple units under their
          indirect control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it
          is possible to create additional units and structures, generally limited by a requirement to expend
          accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or
          possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game
          in the RTS genre features resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect
          control of units.</p>

        <h2>Conceptual features</h2>
        <p>The tasks a player must perform to win an RTS game can be very demanding, and complex user interfaces have
          evolved for them. Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments; for example, the technique of
          "clicking and dragging" to create a box that selects all units under a given area. Though some video game
          genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template, recognized genres are generally not
          subsumed as RTS games. For instance, city-building games, construction and management simulations, and games
          of real-time tactics are generally not considered real-time strategy per se. This would only apply to anything
          considered a god game, where the player assumes a god-like role of creation.</p>
